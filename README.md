# Vulkan-Game-Engine

This repository is an experimental project focused on building a minimal 3D game engine on top of Vulkan, primarily as a learning exercise and a foundation for small games.

The goal is not to create a full-featured engine, but a lean, understandable runtime capable of:

- Rendering low-poly 3D scenes

- Loading simple assets (e.g. glTF)

- Supporting first-person / third-person exploration

Enabling small game prototypes inspired by atmospheric titles like STALKER and Peripeteia
